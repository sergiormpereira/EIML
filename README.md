# EIML

This repository contain code corresponding to the algorithms of the paper "Enhancing interpretability of automatically extracted machine learning features: application to a RBM-Random Forest system on brain lesion segmentation" **(under review)**

## Overview

We share code for two main parts of the proposal:
- Global interpretability
- Local interpretability
